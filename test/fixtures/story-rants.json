{"success":true,"rants":[{"id":938509,"text":"Today we have an exciting devRant announcement! As many observant members of the community have problably noticed, since launch we've been using the domain name devrant.io since the .com was already taken. Today, we're happy to announce, we now own devrant.com and it is now the official devRant URL! \n\nHow did this happen you ask? The devrant.com domain was already owned by a developer named Wiard when we launched devRant. It took a while to track him down, but when we did, turned out he saw the good we were doing and wanted to help the devRant community by generously offering us the .com domain for a very reasonable exchange (considering that we are a self-funded bootstrapped startup!).\n\nSince Wiard recently started writing a blog on devrant.com, he had to find a new home for it. His new blog is https:\/\/sysrant.com and I encourage everyone to check it out! Great topical\/educational dev\/sys-admin related articles? Check. Someone who cares about the devRant community and allowed us to leave the firey hell that is .io? Check. So check it out!!\n\nSome technical info:\n\nThis change is immediate and all devrant.io non-api requests will now redirect to devrant.com. We might have missed a few things (purposely or accidentely) so we're going to be going through and converting anything that's left. If you use the devRant API, your implementation should not break since API requests are meant to be excluded for now, but I highly recommend switching any API URLs to https:\/\/devrant.com so you can avoid issues in the future if we decide to stop redirecting devrant.io API requests. Also one note, there was an issue for about a minute after we turned on the redirected where some API requests to devrant.io might have 301 redirected to devrant.com. If an app you were using broke, try clearing whatever cache the 301 redirect might be stored in and the issue should go away.\n\nFeel free to post any questions you might have here (and please let me know about any issues you might discover!), and once again, huge thanks to Wiard!","score":367,"created_time":1508704138,"attached_image":{"url":"https:\/\/img.devrant.com\/devrant\/rant\/r_938509_Y7eVa.jpg","width":700,"height":324},"num_comments":64,"tags":["devrant","devrant.com"],"vote_state":0,"edited":true,"rt":1,"rc":7,"links":[{"type":"url","url":"https:\/\/sysrant.com","short_url":"https:\/\/sysrant.com","title":"https:\/\/sysrant.com","start":807,"end":826,"special":1},{"type":"url","url":"https:\/\/devrant.com","short_url":"https:\/\/devrant.com","title":"https:\/\/devrant.com","start":1475,"end":1494,"special":1}],"special":true,"user_id":487,"user_username":"dfox","user_score":34492,"user_avatar":{"b":"2a8b9d","i":"v-18_c-3_b-4_g-m_9-1_1-9_16-5_3-1_8-3_7-3_5-1_12-9_6-47_2-57_15-11_18-4_4-1_19-1_20-9_21-1.jpg"},"user_avatar_lg":{"b":"2a8b9d","i":"v-18_c-1_b-4_g-m_9-1_1-9_16-5_3-1_8-3_7-3_5-1_12-9_6-47_2-57_15-11_18-4_4-1_19-1_20-9_21-1.png"},"user_dpp":1},{"id":925451,"text":"Long but worth it...\n\nSo I was cleaning out my Google Drive last night, and deleted some old (2 years and up) files. I also deleted my old work folder, it was for an ISP I worked for over 2 years ago. After deleting the files I had a little twinge of \"Man I hope they're not still using those\". But seriously, it'd be a pretty big security risk if I was still the owner of those files... right? Surely they copied them and deleted all the info from the originals. IP addresses, Cisco configs, username and passwords for various devices, pretty much everything but customer info.\n\nGuess who I get a call from this morning... \"Hi this is Debbie from 'ISP'. I was trying to access the IP Master List and I can't anymore. I was just told to call you and see if there's any way to get access to it again\" (Not her real name...)\n\nI had to put her on hold so I could almost die of laughter...\n\nMe: \"Sorry about that Debbie, I haven't worked for that company for over 2 years.

The environment over there was pretty toxic anyway...\n\nI feel bad for \"Debbie\" and the other staff there, it's going to be a very bad week for them. I also hope it doesn't impact any customers. But... It is funny as hell, especially since I warned the owner as I was clearing out my desk to save copies, and plan on them being gone soon.

They wanted all their houses shown on a map, divided into particular areas, tagged with particular characteristics, so they were easy to filter, by number of square meters, area, features, etc.\n\nIt started with the database. They wanted me to read the existing real estate data, but weren't willing at all to give me the credentials. I told them I couldn't read from the database without the access credentials, but they kept refusing to hand them over to me and instead started questioning my integrity as a dev.\n\n\"WHAT THE FUCK YOU CUNTS?! HOW AM.I SUPPOSED TOBUSE YOUR DATABASE AND EXISTING DATA WITHOUT AT LEAST BEING ABLE TO FUCKING READ TO THE DB? \n\nSo I offered to start by reading data from a file that resembles the database structure, but they told me I was to set the data\/table structure which made even less sense.\n\nFor weeks nothing happened, because they couldn't or didn't want to understand, until my project manager and me finally got them gathered for a call, and had a long talk with this fucking bunch of morons.\n\nThe both funniest and saddest thing was that they actually had no clue whatsoever and redirected all our request to their 'systems administrator'. He was one middle-aged guy who was responsible for PHP4 and and old ass MySQL setup on a crappy hoster, even though the hoster had long offered the possibilty to update to the latest PHP5 version.\n\nIt took another week before we got access and I got a straight 20 minute laughing fit when I saw the abovementioned setup. Loose files everywhere. They weren't even using the MVC patterns for their current big ass crap pile of a website.\n\nBut now I had access to the database. I barely managed to pull a backups of all the files and database, before that so-called sys admin of theirs revoked my access again. What a fucking tool that guy was, but I had expected that. I just got the data so I'd have all I needec for a local setup.\n\nI build the system the way it made sense and the way we had agreed upon (as far as it was even possible, since those tools seemed to live in a weird fantasy world).\n\nAfter a few weeks in which we had to pull every extra bit of information we needed out of their arses, I got a prototype ready. It was the first project I had build with AngularJS, so I was extra annoyed already, but I managed to build a really cool system with the few things I had.\n\n* the site was fully responsive\n* its center part was a Google map with about a hundred markers nicely divided into clusters which represented their houses (since a house has several apartments, which are in the same location in 2D space\n* there was a list of apartments with their respective characteristics and images, so you could click on an apartment and it was shown on the map, with additional information above the marker\n* I had build a script that pulled the coordinates via Google's geo location automatically and saved them in the DB, so the data wouldn't have to be geocoded everytime, whenever somebody added a new apartment to the database\n\nI though it was absolutely beautiful and probably the most sophisticated app I had built so far. They thought it was crap. Of course.\n\nThey (read: their so-called sys admin) were pissed that I had added a new field for the coordinates to the table, event hough they told me to create the schema and all I had done was add a field to the original data and clean it up. Fucking idiot.\n\nAlso they were too stupid to use the filters and actually demanded we take them away even though filtering the data was one of the most important features in the first place. Then they demanded a feature to show the precincts their houses were divided into, but weren't able to tell us were those lay in the first place.\n\nOne of those idiots actually called me and started blabbering about street names and giving descritions of those areas. I hadn't ever been there, let alone had a map to even comprehend his chaotic descriptions. It took me ten minutes before I could get between his blabbering to ask him what the fuck he was even talking about. When he told me to get a pen and notebook to write down descriptions of their real estate precincts I snapped. I told the moron to print out a map, draw in and name the areas as exactly as possible (because obviously they were too stupid to understand how Google maps worked either) and mail them to us. I was convinced that would be the only thing they'd be capable of.\n\nA few days later we received a list of addresses via email, without further notice what they represented and whether or how they were interconnected, so we ignored the email, knowing they'd have done something wrong again anyway.\n\n1\/2","score":146,"created_time":1508747909,"attached_image":"","num_comments":25,"tags":["angularjs","real estate","'sys admin'","wk75","moronic clients"],"vote_state":0,"edited":false,"rt":1,"rc":1,"user_id":141078,"user_username":"AlexDeLarge","user_score":61044,"user_avatar":{"b":"a973a2","i":"v-18_c-3_b-2_g-m_9-1_1-9_16-6_3-11_8-2_7-2_5-2_12-9_6-54_2-50_15-27_11-4_18-4_4-2_19-3_20-14_21-2.jpg"},"user_avatar_lg":{"b":"a973a2","i":"v-18_c-1_b-2_g-m_9-1_1-9_16-6_3-11_8-2_7-2_5-2_12-9_6-54_2-50_15-27_11-4_18-4_4-2_19-3_20-14_21-2.png"},"user_dpp":1},{"id":924392,"text":"Manager: Hey, this is Junior. he will work with you from now on.\nMe: Oh cool, we could use some help.\n(moments later...)\nJunior: Hey i got this error.
